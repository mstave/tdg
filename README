TDG: Todo GUI
Author: Matthew Stave (mstave@gmail.com)

Goals:

	* Make it easier to manage my to do list
	
	* Provide a graphical interface on todo.txt data so that larger lists can more easily
	  be undertood and manipulated

	* Get better at Python

	* Learn Tk

	* No dependencies but a standard Python install, cross-platform

	* Build an extensible foundation for future expansion


Major Files:

	todo_item.py :	An object that abstracts a to-do item, can parse lines in the todo.txt format
	todo_file.py :	An object that abstracts an entire to-do list
	tdg.py    	 :	Tkinter-based GUI
	tdcli.py     :  A basic command-line interface (work in progress)
